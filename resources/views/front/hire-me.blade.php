        <h1>Hire me!</h1>
        <p>
            I offer hourly pairing sessions where we can pair up and write code together. You can purchase pairing sessions based on your needs.
        </p>
        <h2>What we can pair on?</h2>
        <p>
            I have about 9 years of experience in software development. During this time, I worked mostly on PHP and Laravel.
            We can pair on any laravel related topic and any of my open source packages.
        </p>

        <h3>How long are the sessions?</h3>
        <p>
            One session is one hour. We can also schedule 30 minutes sessions for small topics.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I schedule a pairing session?</h3>
        <p>
            You can <a class="underline" href="{{ route('products.index') }}">buy one pairing session on my products page</a>. I'll reach out to you to schedule it.
        </p>

        <h3>How many people can join each session?</h3>
        <p>
            I can pair with a party of 3 people.
        </p>
